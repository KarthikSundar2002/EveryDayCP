# EveryDayCP
It is a desktop application which shows stuff related to Competitive Programming everytime it launches. 

I wanted to learn electron and also I had to learn Competitve Programming, so I had to make this project. It is an electron-app which scrapes one of the most useful references
out there [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/).

You can dowinload the ubuntu installer [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BC9kEFHReBTteaVkMzxNUi_p6OqXp0AN?usp=sharing).

To locally build it, follow the command below
```
  npm install --save-dev @electron-forge/cli
  npx electron-forge import
  npm run make
```
